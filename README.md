This note book also shows interactives solutions for certain figures of the decadal report that are going to be used for the storyboard:

- [Figure 11 : Evolution of the global mean sea level](#11_inter)
- [Figure 14 : Mass changes of reference glaciers ](#14_inter)
- [Figure 16 : Cumulative annual and decadal ice sheet mass change from 1992 to 2020](#16_inter)
- [Figure 17 : Sea ice extent for the Arctic (left) and Antarctic (right) ](#17_inter)

Finally the note book also helps to create gif animations solutions for certain figures of the decadal report that are going to be used for certain social medias publications:

- [Figure 9 : Ocean Heat Content (OHC)](#9_gif)
- [Figure 11 : Evolution of the global mean sea level](#11_gif)
- [Figure 14 : Mass changes of reference glaciers ](#14_gif)
- [Figure 16 : Cumulative annual and decadal ice sheet mass change from 1992 to 2020](#16_gif)
- [Figure 17 : Sea ice extent for the Arctic (left) and Antarctic (right) ](#17_gif)
